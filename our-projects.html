          <!-- <h4>Business Analysis</h4> -->
          <p>We have worked with a wide variety of organizations in many different industries. Our clients have ranged
            in size from small businesses requiring advanced web presence to major corporations requiring niche
            expertise and great attention to detail.</p>

          <h4>JSF Technologies</h4>
          <p>Assistance in the development of a web-based application for customers to view and manage solar powered
            pedestrian-controlled crosswalk and school zone beacons. The system supports manufacturer testing,
            registration to customers, management of flash schedule, GPS tracking system, beacon status reporting, and
            event alerting for IoT devices which communicate via custom protocol. Involved in all aspects of the
            project: requirements definition, feature specification, architecture, development, CI system management,
            Azure environment configuration and management.</p>
          <p>Technologies: C#, .NET Core, Angular, TypeScript, SQL Server, Azure, Docker, TeamCity</p>

          <h4>Yukon First Nation</h4>
          <p>Analysis of purchased Land Management System to track usage and engagement on the First Nation's land.
            Reviewed requirements vs. actual, architecture, security, and code. Deliverable was a written report on the
            status of the system as well as items that would need addressing prior to putting the system into
            production.</p>

          <h4>Varsity Tutors</h4>
          <p>Provided system architecture and software development services to support Varsity's distributed workforce
            and online tutoring platform. Work includes development of web-based recruiting management system, tutor
            scheduling system, and in-browser VOIP systems, amongst other things.</p>
          <p>Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Go, MySQL, Redis, DynamoDB, and HTML5.</p>

          <h4>Government of Yukon</h4>
          <p>Implemented an interactive Capacity Assessment Tool based on a written document developed by the Government
            of Yukon in partnership wih the Carcross/Tagish First Nation, Kwanlin Dün First Nation and Vuntut Gwitchin
            First Nation. The interactive tool is intended to be used to identify a First Nations government, department
            or organization’s strengths and weaknesses, guiding the user through a capacity assessment with tips, advice
            and worksheets.</p>
          <p>Technologies: ASP.NET, Javascript, and SQL Server.</p>

          <h4>Stanton Magnetics</h4>
          <p>Oranj Solutions' role within the SCS.1 project ran the gamut from business analysis and specification
            writing to technical architecture to development. Our work was mainly focused on the computer application
            side (C++/JUCE for cross-platform), including development of a custom test application for use during
            manufacturing, however we also assisted with work on firmware for Atmel and Oxford processors (C/C++) and
            driver/protocol design. In addition, Oranj Solutions was responsible for providing the configuration
            management and server administration (Subversion, Debian).</p>

          <h4>Fare Logistics</h4>
          <p>Fare Logistics engaged the services of Oranj Solutions to provide configuration management (source control)
            and build systems to support the entire range of their software products. The configuration management was
            handled by Subversion running on Ubuntu linux and, once setup and laid out, required only periodic
            maintenance support. The build systems were custom built for the team's .NET 2.0, .NET 1.1, and Embedded C++
            integrated projects. Features included a webservice and front-end for conducting manual builds, and a
            database and notification system for tracking build results and error logs.</p>

          <h4>Trafford Publishing</h4>
          <p>Oranj Solutions was brought in to lead the development team and to provide architectural and development
            assistance on Trafford's sales and marketing tools and applications. Mainly this involved working within an
            existing framework of .NET applications (VB.NET v1.1) to add new features and make bug fixes. Working on
            these critical business systems meant that rigorous test and deployment procedures had to be established to
            ensure a minimal amount of service interruption when performing upgrades. In one instance, a maximum of only
            5 minutes of downtime was deemed tolerable when rolling out sweeping changes to a 13GB database.</p>
